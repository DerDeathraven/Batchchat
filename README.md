# Batchchat
This Chat-App was developed back in Highschool. This school featured a shared server space.
The main idea was to use that to our advantage. We started by just using the cmd and ofcourse green colors.
what is astounding to me in hindsight is that it ran as well as it did with around 15 people using it.

Please keep in mind that this was developed when i was around 15.
